            How awesome it would be to visit a foreign country and explore
            cities, towns, and architecture! I would hit up an italian
            restaurant and order some special cuisine and marinara to boot! I
            imagine myself being that tourist to get that special picture of
            buildings and bridges surrounded by water. For selfish reasons would
            get a "selfie" of proof I was there like that famous canal in
            Venice, Italy.

            The great outdoors never gets old! Recreation is where it is at
            where camping is at the heart of it. I will treat it like an
            itinerary, arrive at campground site and set up shop and realize my
            plans! I'm going to prepare for my dinner meal of dutch oven food
            and enjoy the starlit night sky around the campfire with my family
            and friends. We have plans- Hike, bike, swim, or even catch a hidden
            waterfall! National parks, forests, or some other oasis terrain -
            Here we come!

            Now this last idea is unique for me. I would fancy excitement on
            vacation touring a vineyard operation or farming high tech
            enterprise. Food taste testing like trying out some sharp cheddar
            cheese, some decadent chocolate, or some savory drink, the
            possibilities are numerous. I love food and it fascinates me to know
            the process of where it comes from. Wether that is out in a field
            with rows of grape vines, checking out some vertical towers in a
            high tech greenhouse, or touring a production factory of how the
            magic happens to create that special product.
